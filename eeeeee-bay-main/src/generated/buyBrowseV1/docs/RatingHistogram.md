**count** | **Number** | The total number of user ratings that the product has received. | [optional] 
**rating** | **String** | This is the average rating for the product. As part of a product review, users rate the product. Products are rated from one star (terrible) to five stars (excellent), with each star having a corresponding point value - one star gets 1 point, two stars get 2 points, and so on. If a product had one four-star rating and one five-star rating, its average rating would be &lt;code&gt; 4.5&lt;/code&gt;, and this is the value that would appear in this field. | [optional]
